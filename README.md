                                                         INTERNSHIP PROJECT
This repository contains the projects I worked on during my internship. These projects helped me gain hands-on experience with Python programming and software development. Below is a brief description of each project:

1.Word Guessing Game
   
Overview:

The Word Guessing Game is a simple text-based game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the word and reveals the correct positions of guessed letters.

Key Features:

a.Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.

b.Tracks the number of incorrect guesses and limits the number of attempts.

c.Displays the partially guessed word to the player after each guess.

d.Includes a simple interface for user input and feedback.

Skills Demonstrated:

a.Basic control structures (loops, conditionals).

b.String manipulation.

c.User input handling.

d.Random generation.

2.Tic-Tac-Toe Game
   
Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic two-player game implemented in Python. Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The game determines the winner based on the standard rules or declares a draw if no player wins.

Key Features:

a.Allows two players to compete on the same computer.

b.Check for win conditions after each move.

c.Resets the game for a new round after the current game ends.

Skills Demonstrated:

a.Implementing game logic and rules.

b.Handling user interactions.

c.Developing a turn-based game system.

3.Desktop Notifier

Overview

The Desktop Notifier is a small utility that displays notifications on your desktop at specified intervals. It is useful for reminding users about tasks, events, or important updates.

Key Features:

a.Uses the plyer library to create cross-platform desktop notifications.

b.Configurable notification intervals and messages.

c.Runs in the background and can be customized for various use cases.

Skills Demonstrated:

a.Working with external libraries (plyer).

b.Implementing background tasks in Python.

c.Creating and scheduling desktop notifications.

d.Basic time management and automation techniques.


Conclusion

These projects allowed me to develop and apply programming skills in practical scenarios. Each task provided a unique challenge, helping me improve my problem-solving abilities and gain experience with different aspects of software development.
